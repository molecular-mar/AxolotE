# AxolotE: Python implementation

Files for the generation of code with the E Coefficients expressions.

In concrete:

* *ERecurrence.py* contains the actual recurrence relationships.
* *EGenerator.py* has instructions for writing the coefficients in Mathematica format.
* *CppCodeGenerator.py* can be used to produce the C++ source code for the coefficients.

Files in the *starters/* folder are used for the production of the source code.
